### Application Purpose

Between 1961 and 1994, the number of houses in Australia more than doubled from 2.8 million to 6.7 million. [(The Evolution of Australian Home Building)](https://www.architectureanddesign.com.au/features/comment/the-evolution-of-australian-home-building) Due to modern updates and discoveries in building materials and regulations, it is forecast that the amount of renovations needed to be completed on houses built in this time will be rapidly increasing in coming years.  [(Australian Renovation Cost Guide)](https://www.canstar.com.au/home-loans/australian-renovation-cost-guide-not-drill/)

In Australia in 2016, nearly 8.4 million people (62%) of Australians conducted some kind of DIY home renovation. [(Renovation Nation: Home Improvement in Australia)](http://www.roymorgan.com/findings/7102-renovation-nation-home-improvement-in-australia-201701090848) It is a well documented fact that Australians love a Saturday morning trip to Bunnings, with the company reporting revenues in excess of $13.1 billion in  2019.  As such, it can be reasonably concluded that there is substantial demand in the Australian market for access to tools and hardware in order to complete DIY projects and renovations. 

Outside of professional tradespeople, many DIYers wouldn’t need access to this hardware beyond the timeframe of their projects. Yet, of the 8.4 million people who undertook DIY projects, more than 2.2 million (26%) spent more than $5000 on these renovations.  [(Renovation Nation: Home Improvement in Australia)](http://www.roymorgan.com/findings/7102-renovation-nation-home-improvement-in-australia-201701090848)

By having access to the tools and hardware required at a cheap rate, for the duration of a project, Australian DIYers can get more ‘bang for their buck’ when it comes to undertaking renovations.

Although businesses such as Kennards Hire exist to fill this gap, the profit-driven nature of the business means costs of these services can sometimes be high enough that it’s more beneficial for someone to purchase the tool. In instances where people do purchase tools themselves, it is extremely likely that they won’t be using them most of the time, regardless of whether hiring costs made an impact on that decision.

**Mates Rates solves all of these problems at once by providing a platform for tool owners to rent out their hardware to those looking at completing DIY projects.** Tool owners can earn money from hardware that ordinarily would be collecting dust, while DIYers will be able to use tools at a significantly cheaper rate than the options that exist in the market already.

[Leveld](https://getleveld.com/) is an application that already exists with similar functionality, but appears to have a relatively low user count. Widespread adoption is critical to the success of this product and I believe that Leveld has failed to achieve this (so far) due to the fact that the product hasn’t been marketed correctly.

By focusing exclusively on an Australian audience, where DIY is ingrained into the culture, Mates Rates should be able to capitalise on the market and provide an extremely valuable service to Australian DIYers.
